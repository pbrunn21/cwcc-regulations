# 🍗 CWCC — Chicken Wing Competition Committee

### Official Regulatory Code

---

## Preamble

The Chicken Wing Competition Committee (CWCC) was established to uphold the dignity, integrity, and sauce-covered chaos of competitive wing eating. These codes shall govern all sanctioned events, backyard throwdowns, and Super Bowl party disputes.

---

## § 7.4.2(b) — Boneless Wing Eligibility

> *"Boneless wings, despite their controversial nature, shall be permitted in all sanctioned competition categories, provided they are consumed with the same enthusiasm and disregard for personal dignity as their bone-in counterparts."*

**Effective Date:** Whenever someone starts arguing about it at the cookout.

## Additional Codes

### § 1.1.0 — Definition of a Wing
A "wing" is defined as any piece of chicken that has been fried, baked, grilled, or otherwise prepared in a manner that makes it acceptable to eat with one's hands while standing over a sink.

### § 3.2.1 — Sauce Requirements
All competition wings must be sauced or seasoned. Plain, unseasoned wings are a violation of the CWCC code and, frankly, a violation of common decency.

### § 5.0.0 — The Ranch vs. Blue Cheese Debate
The CWCC takes no official position on this matter. Competitors may use either dipping sauce without penalty. **However**, the committee acknowledges this debate has ended friendships and will not be held liable for any disputes arising thereof.

### § 6.6.1 — Flat vs. Drum Preference
No competitor shall be shamed for preferring flats over drums, or vice versa. Both are valid. This is a safe space.

### § 9.0.3 — Napkin Clause
Any competitor who claims they "don't need a napkin" shall be monitored closely, as they are either lying or a menace to society.
